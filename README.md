# sMNP
Software implemented in Cpp and R for fitting symmetric multinomial probit models.  The full package is under construction (including detailed function documentation), but the main functions are up and running!  

This is an implementation is based on the paper [A Symmetric Prior for Multinomial Probit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10334). If used, please cite the paper.

To use, first install devtools:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```
and then, install the package:
```R
